# We Built a Computer!

[Benjamin](/benjamin) 27th July 2020

Over the past couple of days, we've been building a computer! Our old computer was very outdated, and hardly anything could run on it (for instance, because Ubuntu switched from using Unity, it's own desktop environment, to using Gnome 3, which is much more memory-consuming, we had to swich to using Lubuntu's desktop environment, LXDE, because videos wouldn't play without the computer crashing, and not much else would work. Basically, because of an update, our computer could not run the new desktop while doing things like playing videos, and so we had to install a more lightweight version. Sorry about all the computer words :wink:).

The parts for the new computer arrived over the next few days, and then we started building. It was a mess, both in the computer case and on the table. Boxes were everywhere, instruction manuals were also everywhere, spare cables were all over the place and inside the box, you cound hardly see the computer for all the wires everywhere! Tidying took forever, and then the next day, while my dad was tidying up the wires in the computer, I decide to take apart the old computer to use some of the components we weren't using, and ended up making marks on the table from the rubber feet, which luckily rubbed off, and breathing in a lot of dust. Luckily, I'm fine now, and the computer is now (almost) ready to use (just a bit of configuration in the BIOS and connecting it to the screen, power and everything else it needs to be connected to)

The case even has a window, and because many of the components were for gaming computers, some of the fans were red and it also has built in orange lights! Not the most efficient use of power, but it is nice :laughing:.

I'll  attach some photos soon, but goodbye for now!
