# Playing, Schoolwork and What Else?

[Benjamin](/benjamin), 20th May 2020

Yes... what else? It's been a pretty average (*lockdown*) day. Hmmm....

Ah yes... yesterday I went on a car journey for the first time in a couple of months. I felt sick from that. I normally get carsick going where we were going, and well - I hadn't been in a car for months, as I said earlier, and so felt extremely sick.

But at least we're alowed unlimited excersise outside of the house and allowed car journeys so long as we're back before nightfall! I've been getting bored of the repetitivness (ever noticed that the word repetetive it repetetive) of all our usual walk routes.

Then we've been playing in my sister's mud kitchen (it's surprising how fun it is) and are running out of sand that hasn't been mixed with soil!

I've been programming (a bit) and looking through github (like facebook but for programming) for something interesting (a lot). Oh, and been doing markdown (a programming language to create documents (that's what this is written in by the way)) to write blog posts.

I've just realized how much I like brackets (or at least how much I use them)!

So that's all I have time to write as it's lunch soon, so goodbye for now!

Benjamin
