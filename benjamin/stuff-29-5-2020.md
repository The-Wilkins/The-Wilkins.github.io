# Stuff

Sorry I've not written for the past week - I've been doing a lot of programming projects.

Last post's emoji question was goodbye.

I'm currently coding a [rebus puzzle](https://benjamin-wilkins.github.io/rebuses), where text is represented with pictures (or in this case, emoji).

Note: not all emojis are represented in all browsers.

I've been reading all morning some days, and have made my way through a great deal of mystery books.

Also, we've gone dam building and gone on long walks through the Peak District.

Today I'll add an morse code:

`.... . .-.. .-.. ---`

Goodbye,

Benjamin
