# Birthdays

[Benjamin](/benjamin), 19th May 2020

May and June are definately the time for birthdays - there's been quite a few birthdays lately, including my sister's 7th birthday yesterday, a friend's 11th today, and my 11th in just under 2 weeks, followed by a few more family birthdays.

For the past few weeks, we've been DIYing an old cupboard into a mud kitchen for my sister - difficult as we were all in the garden at once due to lockdown, including my sister, and because a random cat decided to come to our garden and kept on almost steping in the paint.

Then a couple of days ago we were making a Frozen cake for my sister, so I ended up making an Olaf (snowman character from Frozen) and Snowgies (tiny mischiveous snowmans from Frozen) out of icing - extremely fiddly as they're tiny __*and*__ the black icing we used to make eyes and a smile was not sticking to the Snowgies.

Goodbye for now!
